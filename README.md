- 👋 Hi, I’m @MPEDRLone
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, Linux, Coding, and Ethical Hacking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning basics and best practices for cybersecurity, linux command line, python and researching how to get my certifications
- 💞️ I’m hoping to get some recomendations on certain books or just advice on how I jump over some hurdles that I could face in the future.
